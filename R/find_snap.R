#' Find snapped locations of input points on street network
#'
#' @description R5 tries to snap origin and destination points to the street
#' network in two rounds. First, it uses a search radius of 300 meters. If the
#' first round is unsuccessful, then R5 expands the search radius to 1.6 km.
#' Points that aren't linked to the street network after those two rounds are
#' returned with `NA` coordinates and `found = FALSE`. Please note that the
#' location of the snapped points depends on the transport mode set by the user.
#'
#'
#' @param r5r_core a rJava object to connect with R5 routing engine
#' @param points a spatial sf POINT object, or a data.frame
#'               containing the columns 'id', 'lon', 'lat'
#' @param mode string. Defaults to "WALK", also allows "BICYCLE", and "CAR".
#'
#' @return A data.table with the original points as well as their respective
#'         snapped coordinates on the street network and the Euclidean distance
#'         between original points and their respective snapped location. Points
#'         that could not be snapped show `NA` coordinates and `found = FALSE`.
